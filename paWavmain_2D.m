%% Here to calculate the pixel-wise fiber orientation 
armd = 3; % modify 2
% The width of window for orientation calculation is '2*armd+1'.
% 'armd' is chosen based on the diamater of fibers. Typically '2*armd+1'

% 'calcfibangspeed.m' is the function which calculates the pixel-wise
% orientation of a fiber image. 'aS' is the output of the orientation
% matrix in the radian form(range from 0-pi) while 'aSDE' the angle 
% form(range from 0-180).

%% Here to create the mask selecting fiber regions

% The width of window for waviness calculation in 'x' and 'y' dimensions
% is '2*wavarmdx+1' and '2*wavarmdy+1', and normally these two value remain
% the same. 'wavarmdx' and 'wavarmdx' are chosen based on the diamater 
% of fibers. Typically '2*wavarmdx/wavarmdy+1' is 5 to 6 times the diameter of fiber.
[wavmatr] = wavwin_cal2D(wavarmdy,wavarmdx,aSDE,double(finalmask),sz1,sz2);
Meanwav = mean(wavmatr(finalmask));
% 'wavwin_cal.m' is the function which calculates the pixel-wise
% waviness of a fiber image. Width of window 'wavarmdx' and 'wavarmdy', 
% orientation matrix 'aSDE', size of the fiber image 'sz1' and 'sz2' are
% the input parameters for the waviness calculation function.
%'wavmatr' is the output waviness matrix. 'Meanwav' is the mean waviness of 
% all the fiber pixels selected  by 'finalmask' in the image.

%% Here to do post-processing.
% For post-processing, we prepare the 'pretty' images of orientation and
% waviness. In these 'pretty' images, the raw intensity image 
% is used to provide the contrast of fiber features, and the orientation or
% waviness maps are labeled by different colors to show the orientation 
% or waviness information

% first, prepare the pretty waviness map

% 'wavmatr' is the input waviness matrix, 'fiberimgre' is the  normalized 
% raw fiber image.'jet(64)' designates the color scheme. 'uplim' and 'botlim' 
% are the upper and bottom limits of the orientation metric. The range 
% of waviness is 0-1. 'bright' and 'dark' are used to enhance the contrast 
% of the image. 'prettywav' is the output waviness map labeled by different 
% colors to show waviness information.
